### Hi there 👋

I am TheWinner. I am a uni student from Bulgaria currently in the Informatics course (although probably gonna switch to something else but who knows lol).

I am currently helping out with a [Stardew Valley mod](https://github.com/thewinner958/stardew-val-mod) (hosting the repisotory and help with the code) but do want to do other projects. Hell probably gonna use Github for the upcoming uni project

#### Interests
- Valorant (obviously 😅)
- Coding
- aaaand that's about it

was thinking of adding something else but eh, maybe later.


#### Spotify NowPlaying
